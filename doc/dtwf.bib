	abstract = {Haploid population models with non-overlapping generations and fixed population size N are considered. It is assumed that the family sizes $\nu$ 1,...,$\nu$ N within a generation are exchangeable random variables. Rates of convergence for the finite-dimensional distributions of a properly time-scaled ancestral coalescent process are established and expressed in terms of the transition probabilities of the ancestral process, i.e., in terms of the joint factorial moments of the offspring variables $\nu$ 1,...,$\nu$ N. The Kingman coalescent appears in the limit as the population size N tends to infinity if and only if triple mergers are asymptotically negligible in comparison with binary mergers. In this case, a simple upper bound for the rate of convergence of the finite-dimensional distribution is derived. It depends (up to some constants) only on the three factorial moments E(($\nu$ 1)2),E(($\nu$ 1)3) and E(($\nu$ 1)2($\nu$ 2)2), where (x){\_}{\{}k{\}}$\backslash$coloneq x(x-1)$\backslash$cdots (x-k+1) . Examples are the Wright-Fisher model, where the rate of convergence is of order N-1, and the Moran model, with a convergence rate of order N-2.},

	abstract = {We report a complex set of scaling relationships between mutation and reproduction in a simple model of a population. These follow from a consideration of patterns of genetic diversity in a sample of DNA sequences. Five different possible limit processes, each with a different scaled mutation parameter, can be used to describe genetic diversity in a large population. Only one of these corresponds to the usual population genetic model, and the others make drastically different predictions about genetic diversity. The complexity arises because individuals can potentially have very many offspring. To the extent that this occurs in a given species, our results imply that inferences from genetic data made under the usual assumptions are likely to be wrong. Our results also uncover a fundamental difference between populations in which generations are overlapping and those in which generations are discrete. We choose one of the five limit processes that appears to be appropriate for some marine organisms and use a sample of genetic data from a population of Pacific oysters to infer the parameters of the model. The data suggest the presence of rare reproduction events in which âˆ¼8{\%} of the population is replaced by the offspring of a single individual.},

	abstract = {Estimates of gene flow between subpopulations based on F(ST) (or N(ST)) are shown to be confounded by the reproduction parameters of a model of skewed offspring distribution. Genetic evidence of population subdivision can be observed even when gene flow is very high, if the offspring distribution is skewed. A skewed offspring distribution arises when individuals can have very many offspring with some probability. This leads to high probability of identity by descent within subpopulations and results in genetic heterogeneity between subpopulations even when Nm is very large. Thus, we consider a limiting model in which the rates of coalescence and migration can be much higher than for a Wright-Fisher population. We derive the densities of pairwise coalescence times and expressions for F(ST) and other statistics under both the finite island model and a many-demes limit model. The results can explain the observed genetic heterogeneity among subpopulations of certain marine organisms despite substantial gene flow.},
