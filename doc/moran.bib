	abstract = {Coalescent theory provides the foundation for molecular population genetics and genomics. It is the conceptual framework for studies of DNA sequence variation within species, and is the source of essential tools for making inferences about mutation, recombination, population structure and natural selection from DNA sequence data. This monograph is intended mainly for biologists but it will also be of interest to mathematicians who wish to see how this branch of applied probability theory plays out in a biological setting.},

@article{Bhaskar2014,
	abstract = {Study sample sizes in human genetics are growing rapidly, and in due course it will become routine to analyze samples with hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of individuals. In addition to posing computational challenges, such large sample sizes call for carefully reexamining the theoretical foundation underlying commonly used analytical tools. Here, we study the accuracy of the coalescent, a central model for studying the ancestry of a sample of individuals. The coalescent arises as a limit of a large class of random mating models, and it is an accurate approximation to the original model provided that the population size is sufficiently larger than the sample size. We develop a method for performing exact computation in the discrete-time Wright-Fisher (DTWF) model and compare several key genealogical quantities of interest with the coalescent predictions. For recently inferred demographic scenarios, we find that there are a significant number of multiple- and simultaneous-merger events under the DTWF model, which are absent in the coalescent by construction. Furthermore, for large sample sizes, there are noticeable differences in the expected number of rare variants between the coalescent and the DTWF model. To balance the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, we propose a hybrid algorithm that uses the DTWF model for the recent past and the coalescent for the more distant past. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid method with only a handful of generations of the DTWF model leads to a frequency spectrum that is quite close to the prediction of the full DTWF model.},

@article{Tavare1984,
	abstract = {A variety of results for genealogical and line-of-descent processes that arise in connection with the theory of some classical selectively neutral population genetics models are reviewed. While some new results and derivations are included, the principle aim is to demonstrate the central importance and simplicity of genealogical Markov chains in this theory. Considerable attention is given to "diffusion time scale" approximations of such genealogical processes. A wide variety of results pertinent to (diffusion approximations of) the classical multiallele single-locus Wright-Fisher model and its relatives are simplified and unified by this approach. Other examples where such genealogical processes play an explicit role, such as the infinite sites and infinite alleles models, are discussed. ?? 1984.},
