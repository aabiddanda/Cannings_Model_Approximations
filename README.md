Cannings Model Deviations
-------------------------

Rotation project to explore deviations from the Coalescent under various discrete-time Models.

Current directions include:

1. Quantifying Deviations from the Coalescent between the Wright-Fisher Model and the Moran Model

2. 

For more information on either of these directions please see the [doc] folder
